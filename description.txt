This mod adds the Enhanced Clentaminator, a much more capable version of the Clentaminator.
It has an approx. 625 block range per shot, allowing you to absolutely decimate any biome in seconds.
The projectiles have scaled by a factor of 5 and I have added more lighting to the particles for each solution.
It also has a new sprite double the size of the original.
As a side effect the original Clentaminator projectiles have 3x the particles which looks cooler.

[c/d50000:***DO NOT USE IN MULTIPLAYER IT WILL BREAK YOUR WORLD!!!!!!***]
Go into singleplayer, purify then you can save and open your world to multiplayer

Using astral solution from calamity mod is broken and doesn't have particle effects, so not recommended to use with that.
It is recommended that you shoot straight down and walk to ensure you don't purify any biome unintentionally.

This is a craftable item using:
1x Clentaminator
5x Copper Bar
5x Demonite/Crimtane Bar
5x Chlorophyte Bar
5x Hallowed Bar
At a Mythril/Orichalcum anvil.
